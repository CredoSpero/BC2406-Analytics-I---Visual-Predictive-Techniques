This folder contains all the Juypter Notebooks used and the datasets obtained through the notebooks. For a more detailed explanation for each notebook, please refer to each individual notebook seperately 


Please refer to the documents in this order:

1. Final Data Extraction
- This notebook outlines the steps we took when extracting data from the raw csv files from various data sources. 
	The spreadsheet used in this notebook is:
		a. "asia_dataset_not_full": Spreadsheet which was downloaded from our Google Sheet (spreadsheet which contains all our variables and its values(now NAs), eventually replaced with asia_continent_dataset)
	The output of this notebook is: 
		a. "asia_data_extracted": Spreadsheet which is to be added onto the Google Sheet to replace the NA values of the variables 


2. Final Data Cleaning 
- This notebook outlines the steps we took to clean our dataset
	The spreadsheet used in this notebook is: 
		a. "asia_continent_dataset": Spreadsheet which contains all the data for all the variables we used, however, the data is not cleaned
	The output of this notebook is: 
		a. "final_asia_dataset_cleaned: This is the baseline spreadsheet that has it's values cleaned 

3. Feature Scaling 
- This notebook outlines the steps we took to normalize/ standardize our dataset (for Linear Regression)
	The spreadsheet used in this notebook is:
		a. "final_asia_dataset_cleaned
	THe output of this notebook is:
		a. "standardised_final_asia_dataset"
		b. "normalised_final_asia_dataset"


Some other spreadsheets used are:
1. "final_asia_dataset_cleaned_mean": Where we replaced NA values with mean 
2. "final_asia_dataset_cleaned_more": Where we further cleaned the data to achieve a more optimal dataset for our CART model
