In this folder, there is a total of 4 CART R-Scripts and 2 Linear Regression R-Scripts

CART with original cleaned dataset: Model was trained with the "final_asia_dataset_cleaned.csv" file 
CART with 10 NA values and less: Model was trained with the "final_asia_dataset_cleaned.csv" file but variables with more than 10 NAs are removed 
CART with NAs replaced with mean: Model was trained with the "final_asia_dataset_cleaned_mean.csv" file 
CART with EIU baseline model: Model was trained with the "final_asia_dataset_cleaned.csv" file but only EIU variables were used 
 
Linear Regression with stardardised data: Model was trained with the "standardised_final_asia_dataset.csv" file
Linear Regression with EIU baseline model: Model was trained with the "standardised_final_asia_dataset.csv" file but with just EIU variables 

-- Note that as the datasets used are in a seperate folder. In order to properly run the R code, the R-Scripts should be shifted into the same directory as that of the datasets


This folder also contains 2 Jupyter Notebooks, one for CART and the other for Linear Regression 

The respective Jupyter Notebook is a collection of all the R-scripts with outputs already ran for easier viewing
